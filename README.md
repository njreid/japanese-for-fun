Of course. Here is a detailed 6-month plan to teach a 6-year-old Japanese from scratch, designed to be fun, engaging, and effective.

### Teaching Philosophy & Approach

Teaching a 6-year-old a new language, especially one as different from English as Japanese, requires a specific approach. This plan is built on the following principles:

1.  **Play is Paramount:** Lessons are structured as games, songs, and interactive activities. The child should feel like they are playing, not studying.
2.  **Comprehensible Input:** The focus is on listening and speaking first. The child will absorb the language through context, gestures, pictures, and repetition, not through grammatical explanations.
3.  **Spiral Learning & Repetition:** Concepts are constantly revisited. Each week builds on the last, and dedicated revision days ensure knowledge is retained.
4.  **Concrete to Abstract:** We begin with tangible things in the child's world (family, food, toys) before moving to more complex ideas.
5.  **Short & Consistent:** Lessons are designed for a young child's attention span (15-25 minutes) and are held five days a week to build a consistent routine.
6.  **Cultural Snippets:** Simple, fun cultural elements are woven in to make the language come alive.

### Key Materials

- **Visual Aids:** Flashcards (pictures, not just words), puppets, children's books.
- **Craft Supplies:** Colored paper, crayons, scissors, glue.
- **Music & Videos:** Access to Japanese children's songs and simple shows on YouTube.
- **Real-world Objects:** Toys, fruit, snacks, and other household items.
